            <p>
                After wrapping up the research, it was time to create a prototype for our website. We included most of the features that were recommended to us through the research. 
                We opted for a minimalistic design and decided to incorporate our brand colors. Features such as light/dark mode and content similar to our previous project, 
                along with a contact form, were also included. <br>

                During the meeting with our stakeholders, we received positive feedback on the prototype, so we were given the green light to proceed.
