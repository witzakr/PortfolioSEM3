            <p>
                For my front-end assignment, we were tasked with utilizing the Pokémon API to create a website. 
                We had the freedom to develop a game, a Pokédex, or any other application using the API. I chose to build a Pokédex. <br>

                Overall, the assignment was both enjoyable and challenging. 
                Despite having some prior knowledge of working with APIs, 
                I encountered difficulties because the structure of this specific API was different from what 
                I was accustomed to. However, I found it rewarding to adapt and learn as I progressed through the project. Despite the challenges, 
                I managed to successfully complete the assignment, and I had a lot of fun working on it. It was satisfying to see the final outcome and to overcome the obstacles along the way.
