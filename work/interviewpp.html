            <h2>Passionate Project: <span class="red-text">Interview</span></h2>
            <p>
                We carefully prepared an interview for our target group, which consists of small indie companies. 
                After receiving feedback from our teachers, the questions were finalized. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, 
                we were unable to conduct interviews with our target audience. As an alternative, we decided to obtain answers from AI to gauge their usefulness. 
                After discussing this approach with our teachers and receiving approval, we proceeded. 
                To enhance the authenticity, we instructed the AI to role-play as a representative from a small indie studio. The results were very satisfying, 
                and we obtained a lot of interesting answers. rewrite it on high school level
