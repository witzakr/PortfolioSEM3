            <p>
                In order to gather some insight about studio page creation, We created a survey. Unfortunately, the survey couldn't be sent out to our target group, 
                so we decided to send it to individuals who might have expertise in creating a studio page or who have used the services of one. 
                For this task alone, we broadened our target group and sent the survey to people who might have created a studio page themselves or used the services of one.<br>

                Overall, the survey wasn't the biggest success. I discussed it with my teacher, and he told me that he personally isn't a fan of surveys, 
                as it's much better to conduct solid interviews. He mentioned that surveys often provide answers we expect. 
                Nevertheless, we still collected some interesting data that was used in the development process.
