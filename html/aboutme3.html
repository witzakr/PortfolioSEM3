            <h2>Applying <span class="red-text">Feedback</span></h2>
            <p>
                Throughout the semester, one of the crucial tasks was to receive feedback on the work done. 
                This is necessary for many reasons, such as validating, testing, improving, or simply ensuring everything is correct. 
                The feedback I received throughout the semester was very helpful. 
                I got feedback on various tasks ranging from my portfolio and challenges to the group project. 
                Even though it wasn't always clear at first, once understood, it tremendously improved my work. <br>
                The only difficult part for me was due to my habits. I tend to rush into work immediately, which has its pros and cons. 
                However, it's better to be safe than sorry, so validating your work through feedback is essential. 
                Additionally, feedback is a critical part of the learning outcome at this university, making it essential for success.

            <h2>Last <span class="red-text">Day</span></h2>
            <p>
                On Wednesday, we had our Passionate Project presentation, the final feedback session before assesments, 
                and we watched short videos that we had prepared for an assignment in semester 2. 
                It was a day filled with treats in the form of pizza, drinks, and sweets. 
                During the session, we received positive feedback on our Passionate Project, marking it a success. 
                I also received some feedback on my portfolio as the deadline approaches, and together with other students, we watched the videos we had created. <br>
                Overall, it was a fun day and a great way to wrap up the semester. 
                I am really happy with the progress I've made, and I feel prepared to continue expanding my knowledge and skills.
