            <h2>To Do<span class="red-text"> List</span></h2>
            <p>
                The to-do list was an assignment made for front-end development. 
                The task itself was to make a to-do list where the user could put activities manually and sort them.
                The task itself wasn't challenging, but was definitely fun. 
                The way I made it work, is that I made a form in html where the user can input data, 
                and after that, it gets added to the list and displayed in its respective spot. 
                The list is also stored in the LocalStorage, so the activities can be saved after closing the website. 
                Also for each activity, I made a working button, that allows the user to change the status of an activity.
                Overall it was a fun assignment and I am happy with its outcome
