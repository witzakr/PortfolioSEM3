            <h2>Propaedeutic <span class="red-text"> Certificate</span></h2>
            <p>
                On March 13th, I received a propaedeutic certificate from Fontys University, which marks the completion of my first year there. 
                It's a significant achievement for me as it's my first university diploma and an important step in my journey to becoming a full-stack developer. <br>
                The ceremony was enjoyable and meaningful. We got to see some of the best work done by students over the past two semesters, 
                learned about future plans, and received valuable advice. After the ceremony, we had a small party to celebrate everyone's accomplishments. 
                It was a fun way to end the day and mark this milestone in our academic and professional lives.

            <h2>Choosing <span class="red-text"> Specialization</span></h2>
            <p>
                After a thorough thought process of choosing my specialization, I decided to opt for Smart Mobile. 
                Why? Because I believe it aligns perfectly with my skills and passions. What helped me with making 
                my choice was advice from colleagues from higher semesters and assessing what aligns with my skills and profile.
                 After that, I employed the elimination method and ended up choosing that specialization. <br>

                Overall, this moment marks a special milestone in my journey as a media design developer, 
                and I can't wait to embark on it, improve my current skills, and meet like-minded individuals in the field.
