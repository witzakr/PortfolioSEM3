            <p>
                For my assignment, I decided to replicate the Rizon website, which is recognized for its awesome design on awwwards.com. 
                The catch was that I could only use HTML and CSS to recreate it. 
                It was a bit challenging because I had to stick to the original design while working within the limitations of these basic web technologies. 
                Despite the constraints, I successfully completed the task, and it turned out to be a valuable learning experience. 
                This project really pushed me to improve my HTML and CSS skills. I had to pay close attention to the original design 
                and figure out how to make it work using only the fundamentals of web development.
